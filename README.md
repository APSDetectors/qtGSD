# qtGSD
Data converter and visualization for Germanium Strip Detector (192 strips). 

The Germanium Strip Detector (GSD) was developed by Brookhaven and Argonne National Laboratories. 
The GSD consists of a monolithic segmented germanium sensor with spectroscopy highly integrated 
readout (i.e., ASICs) (https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2014.2365358). It is designed for 
powder and energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction techniques at the NSLS-2 and APS synchrotron light sources.
